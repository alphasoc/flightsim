Code in this library was heavily borrowed from https://github.com/ameshkov/dnscrypt.
Also, https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy was used as a point of reference for the
DNSCrypt protocol.  The goal was to provide flightsim with just enough DNSCrypt, without
pulling in too many third party libs.
