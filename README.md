# Network Flight Simulator

**flightsim** is a lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility. The tool performs tests to simulate DNS tunneling, DGA traffic, requests to known active C2 destinations, and other suspicious traffic patterns.

## Installation

Download the latest flightsim binary for your OS from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim/releases) page. Alternatively, the utility can be built using [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) in any environment (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows), as follows:

```
go get -u github.com/alphasoc/flightsim/...
```

## Running Network Flight Simulator

Upon installation, test flightsim as follows:

```
$ flightsim --help

flightsim is an application which generates malicious network traffic for security
teams to evaluate security controls (e.g. firewalls) and ensure that monitoring tools
are able to detect malicious traffic.

Usage:
    flightsim <command> [arguments]

Available commands:
    get         Get a list of elements (ie. families) of a certain category (ie. c2)
    run         Run all modules, or a particular module
    version     Prints the version number

Cheatsheet:
    flightsim run                   Run all the modules
    flightsim run c2                Simulate C2 traffic
    flightsim run c2:trickbot       Simulate C2 traffic for the TrickBot family
    flightsim run ssh-transfer:1GB  Simulate a 1GB SSH/SFTP file transfer
    flightsim run encrypted-dns     Simulate encrypted DNS traffic via DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS and DNSCrypt
    flightsim run encrypted-dns:doh Simulate encrypted DNS traffic via a specific protocol (DNS-over-HTTPS in this case)

    flightsim get families:c2       Get a list of all c2 families
```

The utility runs individual modules to generate malicious traffic. To perform all available tests, simply use `flightsim run` which will generate traffic using the first available non-loopback network interface. **Note:** when running many modules, flightsim will gather destination addresses from the AlphaSOC API, so requires egress Internet access.

To list the available modules, use `flightsim run --help`. To execute a particular test, use `flightsim run <module>`, as below.

```
$ flightsim run --help
usage: flightsim run [flags] [modules]

To run all available modules, call:

    flightsim run

 To run a specific module:

    flightsim run c2

Available modules:

        c2, dga, encrypted-dns, imposter, miner, scan, sink, spambot, ssh-exfil, ssh-transfer, tunnel-dns, tunnel-icmp

Available flags:
  -dry
        print actions without performing any network activity
  -fast
        reduce sleep intervals between simulation events
  -iface string
        network interface or local IP address to use
  -size int
        number of hosts generated for each simulator

$ flightsim run dga

```

The utility also has a `get` command which can be used to query information that can later be used with the simulation modules. At present, a list of C2 families can be obtained to be used with the C2 module. To see how to use the `get` command, run `flightsim get -h` as below.

```
$ flightsim get -h
